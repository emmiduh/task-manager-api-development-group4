# task-manager-api-development-group4
 In this project, we built a Task Management API using Spring Boot, focusing on DevOps practices such as CI/CD, Dockerization, and Kubernetes deployment. The primary goal was to implement a working DevOps pipeline while ensuring the backend application follows best practices for containerization and deployment.
